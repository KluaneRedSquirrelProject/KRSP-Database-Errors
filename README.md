# KRSP-Database-Errors
This repository is designed to track errors in the long-term KRSP database.  Any users of the database should check this repository regularly.

Our basic protocol is to update the long-term database annually when we merge in the new year of annual data.  This is when any errors in the long-term database are corrected.  In the mean time, we need to collate these errors in this location so that users are aware of newly identified errors.

All users of the database are expected to identify report and suggest best possible solutions to any errors in the database that are discovered.  These changes should be suggested here as [Issues](https://github.com/KluaneRedSquirrelProject/KRSP-Database-Errors/issues).  These will then be checked by Andrew before we settle on a final solution to the problem.  These solutions will then be committed to the long-term database when the annual cleanup takes place and the issues will be 'closed'.  All users can then see any remaining issues and make any changes relevant to their project.

Since the database can only be cleaned once a year (i.e. when the annual database is closed) McAdam would like to develop annual R 'patches' for the database, but this has not yet been done.
