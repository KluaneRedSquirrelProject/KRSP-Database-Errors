## 1231 juveniles from 2010 but no notch data and no dna vials.

# 1. Lingering issues from 2015											#
#########################################################################

#Litter ID = 4407; not sure but I think the date1 is wrong.  Weights suggest that Bdate and date2 might be correct.  If so, then date1 should probably be 2009-05-11 instead of 2009-04-26.  If date1 is correct then Bdate should probably be 2009-04-15 and this would make the date2 at 41 days which would be quite the rodeo.  I think the date1 must be wrong.

#ID 20636 â€“ AG squirrel with tag -/H3879 was not in database. Added new id
##  Unclear what squirrel this is.  No change made, but this error has been moved to errorfixes2016 for further review







#Merged Squirrels (Squirrel ID 1; Squirrel ID 2; comments)# 19599 (born on SU), 19910 (trapped on KL); old colours and tags matched.

# 11674, 12435; tags matched, two IDS at the start of 2014
## Note done yet
# 20472, 19282; same squirrel on JO, second id added by mistake
# Looks like two different squirrels in teh database now.  Perhaps they were merged before a new id was added to the new id was reused.  No changes made here.

# 19911; 11895; same squirrel on KL, second id added by mistake
#Merge 19911->11895
